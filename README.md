NAME
====

Hash::LRU - trait for limiting number of keys in hashes by usage

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Hash::LRU;  # Least Recently Used

my %h is LRU;   # defaults to elements => 100

my %h is LRU(elements => 42);  # note: value must be known at compile time!

my %h{Any} is LRU;  # object hashes also supported
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

Hash::LRU provides a `is LRU` trait on `Hash`es as an easy way to limit the number of keys kept in the `Hash`. Keys will be added as long as the number of keys is under the limit. As soon as a new key is added that would exceed the limit, the least recently used key is removed from the `Hash`.

Both "normal" as well as object hashes are supported.

EXAMPLE
=======

```raku
use Hash::LRU;

my %h is LRU(elements => 3);

%h<name>       = "Alex";
%h<language>   = "Raku";
%h<occupation> = "devops";
%h<location>   = "Russia";

say %h.raku;
# {:location("Russia"), :occupation("devops"), :language("Raku")}
```

COMPATIBILITY
=============

Cache::LRU
----------

```raku
#my $cache = Cache::LRU.new(size => 3);
my $cache = my % is LRU(elements  => 3);
```

If your code depended on the now obsolete `Cache::LRU` module, you can use this module instead provided the cache size is known at compile time.

In that case, the above statement change is enough to keep your code working using a maintained module.
